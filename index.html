                <p>I have always been interested in technology and learning new things. I got hooked onto coding by taking a
                    free intro trial with
                    <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jessicaduell">TeamTreehouse.com</a>.</p>
                <p>Since that free trial I have gone on to receive my Associate's Degree in Java. I have also taken the
                    <a href="https://lambdaschool.com">LambdaSchool </a> bootcamp and have learned other languages such as Javascript, HTML and CSS. Through
                    both the degree and the bootcamp I have successfully learned enough languages to become a full stack
                    developer.
